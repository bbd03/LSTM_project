# LSTM Imbalanced-Dataset Classifier

A guideline project demonstrating how to organize and build recurrent neural networks (RNNs)—specifically LSTM-based classifiers—on imbalanced data. This repo provides a clear directory structure, configuration patterns, and training/evaluation scripts so you can adapt the pattern to your own sequence-modeling tasks.

## Features

- **Modular code layout**: clear separation of data loading, model definition, training loop, and evaluation
- **Imbalanced-data handling**: built-in support for class weights and oversampling
- **Config‐driven**: all hyperparameters, paths, and training options live in a single YAML file
- **Logging & checkpoints**: automated saving of best models
- **Easy experiment tracking**: built-in scripts to reproduce experiments from a single command
